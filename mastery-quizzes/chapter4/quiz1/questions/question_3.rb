# Write a program that:
# * Calculates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.
#   * The first Fibonacci number is 0.
#   * The second Fibonacci number is 1.
#   * Every Fibonacci number after that is calculated by adding the
#     previous two Fibonacci numbers together e.g. the third Fibonacci
#     number is the result of `0 + 1`.
# * `puts`es these numbers, one per line.

n1 = 0
n2 = 1

20.times do
  puts n1
  n1, n2 = n2, n1 + n2
end
