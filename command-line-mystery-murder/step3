Reference: ./detective_handbook/step3.md

You found 4 matches for the name 'Annabel'. Only 2 of them are women so you can rule out the remainder. Another piece of information you have is their address. There is a 'streets' subdirectory in the 'mystery' directory with a list of files named after streets.

############ Challenge ###############

See if you can find files matching street names for the two remaining women named 'Annabel'. Use the combinations of commands from the Detective Handbook (section step3) to do this.

######################################


Take a look inside the files you've found, they're big files, aren't they. REMEMBER: among the information available in 'possible_witnesses.txt', you have references to line numbers.

Move on to step4 to find the line we're looking for.
